# SAYNA-BASEFONFDUWEB-PROJET1
Hey!!  
I'm so exited to share you my first code :smiley: Yes, my first!! :woman_technologist:   
This project is divided into three parts: HTML, CSS and Javascript :woman_technologist:    

:woman_technologist: This is a simple interface that shows a brief description of my Facebook page "Journal du bonheur" :heart: :smiley:  
:point_right:My first practice on writing HTML codes, on creating styles with CSS and on small interactive management with Javascript.     
:point_right:You can enter your first name and you will find the link to my page.      

Do you have any suggestions? I love it. I'm open to all proposals and collaborations.  


:+1::+1: Enjoy it and give comments for having a good result together :rocket: :rocket:
